## Instructions

The `FOCUS Explorer` provides an interface to visualize, summarize, and download submission files for the COVID-19 Forecast Hub.

To get started:

1. Select a forecast file from the dropdown
2. Filter by location of interest (default is all locations in the selected file)
3. View visualizations, tabular output, and summary stats
4. Remove locations with implausible forecasts
5. If applicable, download filtered forecast file for submission

**NOTE** It may take a few moments to generate each plot. Be patient on the 'Visualization' tab.
