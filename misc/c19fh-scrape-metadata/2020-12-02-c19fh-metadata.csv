People from the Exposed compartment(E) with symptoms go into the reported infections (Ir) compartment. People with mild or no symptoms go into the unreported infections compartment. Both reported infections (Ir) and unreported infections (Iu) contribute to disease spread, but at different rates - a low spread for people quarantined in compartment Ir, and a high spread for, often, asymptomatic people in compartment Iu. This handles the quarantine measures taken by countries to limit the infections. Some people in reported infections (Iu) recover (compartment C) and some die (compartment D) All people in unreported infections (Iu) recover (compartment Cu), there are no mortalities in this compartment. If their symptoms were serious enough they would be reported (and therefore in compartment Ir). We fit our model to reported confirmed cases and reported deaths in a region to estimate beta1 and beta2 for that region. For other parameters, we use estimates from other studies as starting point and learn using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between projected daily deaths and reported daily deaths.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We provide the following data as a function of time and place: cumulative and daily confirmed cases, cumulative and daily deaths, confirmed case-based and death-based effective transmission ratios, fraction of populations infected and constant infections transmission ratio, probability of Covid-19 contact, mortality and undercount, and fraction of positive tests. Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio, Rt. More specifically we run an SIR model using deaths and another using cases resulting in Rt for deaths and Rt for cases. We use the average of these two as the starting point or driver for our projections (new: 20-10-18). For forecast how Rt will change with time, we analyze Rt change data through the course of the pandemic and apply a model of that characteristic behavior to forecast infections and deaths.

Predictions of cumulative counts are derived from predictions of incidence; this means that the slope of the predictive medians for cumulative quantities from one week to the next will be constant and equal to the last observed slope.  To get a distribution around the median, we look at how much incidence has changed from week to week in the past, and we allow for the possibility that similar changes will occur again in the future.
In more technical detail, forecasts of incidence are generated through the following procedure: 1) Calculate first differences of incidence; 2) Collect all first differences and their negatives; 3) Sample first differences in incidence and add to the most recent observed incidence; 4) Enforce that the mean of the predictive distribution for incidence is equal to the most recent observed incidence; 5) truncate the predictive distribution for incidence at 0.

Moreover, these predictions can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks to identify one or more ""acceptability"" range(s) from observation of the epidemic up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors.

This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters  and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social  distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically  with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days  of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were  drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. 
Stay-at-home orders and  subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according to recent policy documents. States that did not implement stay-at-home orders had a single social distancing intervention that began on the day of the first reported order and endured  for the whole simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where  possible.
To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated  realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to  ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform  a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume a 0.25% infection fatality rate and a 7:1 ratio of incident  hospitalizations to deaths. 
For each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline  reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the  effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an  MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county  aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA  Facts. For the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.
Our procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.
The estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies  on social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and phased reopenings.

We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents’ behavior in response to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent’s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration.

Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks.

The model underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model. Model simulations are initiated by imported infections, which arrive from January 1 onward according to a scaled Normal probability density. Each imported and then local infection gives rise to an average number of secondary infections distributed forward in time according to a generation interval distribution. Once infected, a proportion of those infected die at times distributed according to a distribution between symptom onset and death. Testing of a subset of symptomatic infections is distributed in time in a similar manner, and the model is fitted to data on test positivity by accounting for those seeking testing and a differential probabililty of seeking testing conditional on one's infection status. The model is simultaneously fitted to deaths according to a Poisson likelihood of daily incidence of death. There are a total of twelve model parameters that are all estimated. First, a parameter sweep is conducted to identify the parameter combination from the sweep with the highest likelihood. Then, a region around that parameter combination is assumed to have a uniform prior, and a posterior set of parameters is obtained with MCMC. The model is then simulated forward under each sampled parameter set from the posterior distribution. This process is repeated for each of nine mobility metrics from Apple and Google for 50 states and some territories where at least one type of mobility data is available. Simulations from the posterior predictive distribution of each model are pooled evenly and used to generate a probabilistic forecast in each state and at the national level.",GE and TAP were supported by a RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation (DEB 2027718).,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our compartmental models are based on a discrete form of nonlinear differential equations, parameterized with dynamic functions (i.e. time-dependent transition rates) that incorporate: (1) the modeled effects of physical distancing and government actions; (2) evolving testing practices in terms of timeliness and scale; (3) the link to tracking and contact tracing, and (4) other region-specific characteristics. Our formulation draws on core methods from both epidemiology and physics. It is data-driven to characterize non-linear transition rates and posits underlying causal mechanisms that we have verified against mobility indices representing physical distancing in mass scale and government response actions.  Our models recalibrate daily with the arrival of new information on COVID-19.  By design, the calibration of our models use region-specific data, as the differences in the timing and execution of government restrictions, testing, population density, social behaviour norms and public responses, re-opening plans, and demographics are extremely relevant.

This model is quite  different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning.  We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling  exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative  mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative  mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties.  In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest  of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain  meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above,  fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date.  The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories:  retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in  our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error  analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting  error and the variation of the reference fatality.

This rate along with other model parameters are jointly estimated based on the reported data. The key feature of the SuEIR model is that it can infer the untested cases as well as unreported cases.

Moreover, some of the people in the “Exposed” group can get tested and transferred to the “Infectious” group (which are reported to the public), while the rest of them will recover/die and transit to the so-called “Unreported Recovered” group (which are not reported to the public).

We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score. This new epidemiologically informed risk score leverages subtle geospatial patterns from seasonal flu epidemics of the past, and significantly improves incidence forecasts for COVID-19. Additionally, the UnIT score emerges as the most important factor explaining observed county-specific incidence trends for COVID-19 in the US, with coefficients in multi-variate regression far outweighing those for typical co-variates. Thus, our key insight is that past incidence patterns for a different pathogen can substantially inform current projections, provided the transmission mechanisms are broadly similar. And our key technical contribution is the development of the precise algorithm to transfer this knowledge to the new context, by rigorously estimating thedivergence of hidden generators of complex stochastic phenomena from observation of short sample paths.","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Defense Sciences Office (DSO)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The model is similar to classic SEIR models but with additional compartments for  unreported infections and isolated individuals.  Model parameters describing reporting  rates and transmission rates are allowed to vary in time over over the historical  record as social and policy factors change.  Forecasts into the future, however,  are made under the assumption that the parameters are held constant in time.
The model parameters are estimated from observations of the cumulative number of  cases using a Bayesian approach. Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is  used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters.  This  then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior  probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative  observations and subject matter expertise.  The parameters that maximize the posterior  probability density are used to make forecasts into the future.  The effective reproduction  number is computed using the next-generation matrix method.
